Admitting that what he could do on his own was limited, he thinks of <a href=\"/wiki/Kagaya_Ubuyashiki\" title=\"Kagaya Ubuyashiki\">Kagaya Ubuyashiki</a> and concedes that what the Oyakata had told him was correct. Saying that everything that lives must die and that only feelings were eternal, Muzan says that he did not remember even a single human being he had killed but their feelings had been passed on and had stayed alive, even managing to conquer him.\n</p><p>Being moved to tears at the fact that the feelings of all the people had vanquished him, Muzan is resigned to his inevitable fate. However, he says that his own feelings are eternal and undying just like anyone else's and he extends his hand towards <a href=\"/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado\" title=\"Tanjiro Kamado\">Tanjiro Kamado</a> who was there with him and still alive.\n</p><p>As he gives all of his blood to Tanjiro, Muzan says that if the boy survived this he would become the strongest Demon ever. Since he was the brother of <a href=\"/wiki/Nezuko_Kamado\" title=\"Nezuko Kamado\">Nezuko Kamado</a> who was the first Demon to develop an immunity to sunlight and also the only one capable of using the Breath Style of <a href=\"/wiki/Yoriichi_Tsugikuni\" title=\"Yoriichi Tsugikuni\">Yoriichi Tsugikuni</a>.

To everyone's shock Tanjiro regenerates his left arm and swipes at the Kakushi next to him but Giyu reacts quickly and pushes the Kakushi out of harm's way.\n</p><p>The other Kakushi look on in fear and ask Tanjiro why he is acting in such a manner, as the boy stands drooling profusely, enjoying his newfound fangs and claws. His <a href=\"/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Mark\" title=\"Demon Slayer Mark\">Demon Slayer Mark</a> mutates and grows down to move past the bridge of his nose, with another identical mark growing upwards from his neck to almost meet the other, similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Kokushibo\" title=\"Kokushibo\">Kokushibo</a>'s Mark.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 202px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/0/08/Tanjiro%27s_Demon_appearance.png/revision/latest?cb=20200406152508\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Tanjiro's_Demon_appearance.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"181\" class=\"thumbimage\"></a> \t \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Tanjiro%27s_Demon_appearance.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">Tanjiro as a Demon.</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Giyu rushes forward and yells at the other Kakushi to get away from Tanjiro as the boy looks to swipe at him. Suddenly, the sun shines brightly from the sky and Tanjiro double takes to look at it. He begins to burn and writhes on the ground, with his swipe at the Kakushi going off target but still managing to rip off the lower half of his mask. As Giyu gets in front of the Kakushi, he tells him to run away as he prepares to face this new threat, yelling for anyone who was still conscious to grab a weapon and begin fighting.\n</p><p>Everyone else looks on from afar with confusion at the sudden commotion, unaware of Tanjiro's fate when Giyu suddenly announces to them that Tanjiro has become a Demon. He says that they need to pin Tanjiro down and burn him in the sun before he could kill anyone. Tanjiro suddenly attempts to find shade to stop burning but Giyu intercepts him by stabbing him from the side and dragging him to ground, with the boy clutching at his hair. Noting to himself that if he had not been interrupted by the sun, Tanjiro would have surely killed the Kakushi, Giyu wistfully begs in his mind for Tanjiro to stay who he was and die as a human.\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tleft show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 202px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/ce/Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png/revision/latest?cb=20200406152650\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"167\" class=\"thumbimage lazyload\"></a> \t<noscript><a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/ce/Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png/revision/latest?cb=20200406152650\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/ce/Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20200406152650\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"167\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Tanjiro becomes immune to sunlight.png\" data-image-key=\"Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/ce/Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20200406152650\" /></a></noscript> \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Tanjiro_becomes_immune_to_sunlight.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">Tanjiro becomes immune to sunlight.</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Suddenly, Tanjiro stops burning and Giyu looks on in shock as the boy takes advantage of the Hashira's surprise to swipe at him.
