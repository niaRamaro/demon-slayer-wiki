He explains that she met her demise by Doma's hands, who still believes he is saving her from her abusive household by eating her, but dropped her son off a cliff before the Demon's attack in the hope that he would survive. Memories of her begin to come back to Inosuke, who recalls the song she used to sing to him. Doma calls Kotoha stupid and unfortunate, saying that there isn't a happy moment in her life, and Inosuke, now enraged, thanks Doma for allowing him to remember this story and promises to not only to kill him for what he did to Kotoha and Shinobu, but to put him through hell beforehand.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-0854f4b18fde52dfcf480daca3201188_9-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-0854f4b18fde52dfcf480daca3201188-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 232px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/c4/Inosuke%27s_anger_at_Doma.png/revision/latest?cb=20191110221722\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Inosuke's_anger_at_Doma.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"230\" height=\"199\" class=\"thumbimage lazyload\"></a> \t<noscript><a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/c4/Inosuke%27s_anger_at_Doma.png/revision/latest?cb=20191110221722\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/c4/Inosuke%27s_anger_at_Doma.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/230?cb=20191110221722\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"230\" height=\"199\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Inosuke&#39;s anger at Doma.png\" data-image-key=\"Inosuke&#39;s_anger_at_Doma.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/c4/Inosuke%27s_anger_at_Doma.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/230?cb=20191110221722\" /></a></noscript> \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Inosuke%27s_anger_at_Doma.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">\"If hell doesn't exist, I'll create it for you!!\"</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Doma smiles again, and tells Inosuke that there is no heaven or hell in this world since they're nothing but fantasies created as a coping mechanism for weak humans. Inosuke shouts that he doesn't care if there's no hell because he can just make one himself, and tells Doma not to talk about his mother like she is unhappy.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-252d1fc0066962ed6d6dec95dd97f3f5_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-252d1fc0066962ed6d6dec95dd97f3f5-10\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Demon sends his <b>Freezing Clouds</b> at Inosuke, which he blows away with <b>Beast Breathing: Tenth Fang - Whirling Fangs</b> as Kanao prepares to use another Breath Style to attack him from behind. Doma bats her away with one of his fans and moves away. Inosuke yells at him to get back down so they can continue fighting. He replies that he can't, since Akaza has been defeated and he doesn't have time to play anymore, and uses his <b>Blood Demon Art: Crystalline Divine Child</b> to create smaller clones of himself for Inosuke and Kanao to fight instead. The clones attack the Demon Slayer duo with Doma's techniques as the real Doma starts to walk away, the clones using his <b>Blood Demon Art: Scattering Lotuses</b>, <b>Frozen Lotus</b> and <b>Cold White Princesses</b> attacks to hold the duo back. Now at the exit, Doma thinks about how Inosuke has managed to avoid breathing in the icy air from his techniques, and takes note of his sharp senses, saying he will make sure to remember him. He spectates their battle for a few seconds, observing how they use each technique so that he'll be able to kill them quickly the next time they fight, and then turns back towards the door.\n</p><p>Doma decides to create three more clones to let loose around the castle in order to kill the rest of the Demon Slayers there, and overhears Kanao shouting to Inosuke that they have to hold their ground just a little longer against the crystal children. He wonders what this could mean, but then dismisses it and begins to reach for the door handle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-c4a1a7f81de2050f316ea36afcea4bc8_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-c4a1a7f81de2050f316ea36afcea4bc8-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tleft show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 222px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/e/ea/Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png/revision/latest?cb=20191110221823\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"220\" height=\"304\" class=\"thumbimage lazyload\"></a> \t<noscript><a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/e/ea/Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png/revision/latest?cb=20191110221823\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/e/ea/Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20191110221823\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"220\" height=\"304\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Waterlily Bodhisattva.png\" data-image-key=\"Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/e/ea/Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20191110221823\" /></a></noscript> \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Waterlily_Bodhisattva.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">Rime — Water Lily Bodhisattva.</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Suddenly, Doma's face begins to melt.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-496f24f73ee402f8f2cf30124c491bd2_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-496f24f73ee402f8f2cf30124c491bd2-12\">[12]</a></sup> He drops to the floor, one of his arms snapping off, and his crystal children begin to crack and disintegrate as he wonders what's happening. Inosuke asks if it's a trap but Kanao, having been informed prior to the battle of Shinobu's plan to kill Doma, tells him that it isn't, and that the Demon is being melted by the poison Shinobu had in her body when he consumed her. She tells Inosuke to aim for his neck to finish him off, and, in a panic, Doma plays his final and most powerful card, <b>Blood Demon Art: Rime — Water Lily Bodhisattva</b>.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-049d92698fe173972a6fbb1e32a0be8f_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-049d92698fe173972a6fbb1e32a0be8f-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Doma's ice Bodhisattva statue slams down its hand on the floor of the room, creating a small earthquake that sends Inosuke and Kanao up into the air. Kanao notes that his technique lacks precision, and is clearly the Demon's last effort to protect himself with the little energy he had left, deciding to use her final form, <b>Flower Breathing: Final Form - Equinoctial Vermilion Eye</b> to try and break through him. Doma's statue grabs Inosuke in one of its hands as Kanao leaps towards the Upper Rank, hitting her blade against his neck. She is unable to cut it, so Inosuke, on the spot, comes up with and uses <b>Beast Breathing: Sudden Throwing Strike</b> to hurl his blades at Kanao's to give it the extra strength needed to cut Doma's neck. They succeed in beheading him, Upper Rank 2 and his statue begin to disintegrate.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-b704642f66105f59ef24fb306535122d_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a
