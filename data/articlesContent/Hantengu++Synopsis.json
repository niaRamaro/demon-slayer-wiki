The former congratulated Tanjiro on figuring out their strategy, while the latter commented on Genya's weakness.

However, their attack power had been lessened due to so many divisions, leading Tanjiro to cut them once more. The main body of the harpy-Hantengu appeared behind the young Demon Slayer, firing another sound blast, which was dodged, but followed up by a vicious claw attack to Tanjiro's chest. The harpy-Hantengu boasted about the sharpness of his claws, promising to carve up the young Demon Slayer, only to discover the youth had sliced his face in two. As Tanjiro prepared a follow-up attack, harpy-Hantengu attempted to fire the sound blast once more, only to have his jaw cut off, the final blow incoming.

Tanjiro then unleashed <b>Hinokami Kagura: Dragon Sun Halo Head Dance</b>, inflicting grievous injuries to each of the three emotion Demons. A short distance away, Genya had managed to heavily injure Aizetsu, pinning him to a tree with his own yari and ripping his head off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-bd96d3787914a1bb825bd4985639a1e8_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-bd96d3787914a1bb825bd4985639a1e8-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Each of the Demons hit by Tanjiro's attack reacted differently: Urogi simply screaming in pain, Karaku panicking over his apparent lack of regeneration, and Sekido berating the latter, stating they were still regenerating, but at a much slower pace. Sekido was the first to recover, firing his electricity blast at Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Genya, who were in the process of finding Hantengu's fifth body. Elsewhere, this fifth entity cowered, confident that the other emotion Demons would beat all the \"bad guys\".<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-d5e3f41624ee245483eb8292c0b07315_12-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-d5e3f41624ee245483eb8292c0b07315-12\">[12]</a></sup> Tanjiro directed Genya towards the location of the fifth Hantengu, with Nezuko and himself providing cover for their scarred ally, with an immediate attack launched by Karaku, forcing the youth to grip a nearby tree while Sekido prepared to attack once more. He was attacked by Nezuko, who was immediately pierced by a recovered Aizetsu, who Sekido also attempted to attack, only to have his shakujō hand severed by Tanjiro.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-3ed40eebd97dcec4423080b5af966750_13-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-3ed40eebd97dcec4423080b5af966750-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tleft show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 202px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/cd/Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png/revision/latest?cb=20180708042839\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"215\" class=\"thumbimage lazyload\"></a> \t<noscript><a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/cd/Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png/revision/latest?cb=20180708042839\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/cd/Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20180708042839\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"215\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Genya discovers fifth Hantengu.png\" data-image-key=\"Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/c/cd/Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20180708042839\" /></a></noscript> \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Genya_discovers_fifth_Hantengu.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">Despite his best efforts, Hantengu's fifth body is discovered by Genya</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure> \n<p>Sekido realized that the youth was improving in ability as the battle progressed, just as he had been told and had observed thus far, noting he experienced explosive growth in critical situations. Urogi's right wing was subsequently severed by Tanjiro, and Aizetsu was grabbed by Nezuko's using both her hands and feet and lit on fire. Seeing this, Sekido desperately looked to see what Karaku was up to. Urogi used his fan to crush Tanjiro into the ground, turning to attack one of the others, only for his fan arm and fan to be split in two by the youth's fiery counterattack. Furious, he stomped on the youth, who continued to give Genya directions on how to find the Upper Rank's fifth body. The two were ultimately successful, the fifth Hantengu cowering at the sight of Genya. The scarred youth shot at the tiny emotion Demon, to no effect, but the miniature Hantengu ran from him regardless. He was pursued by Genya, who swung his blade at the Fear Demon's neck, only for it to break. Another gunshot yielded a similar result, with Sekido attacking Genya from behind almost immediately afterward.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-6261495117f3e38332f19cee0674179a_14-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-6261495117f3e38332f19cee0674179a-14\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<figure class=\"thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 202px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/a/aa/Hatred_Hantengu.png/revision/latest?cb=20180711164234\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/Hatred_Hantengu.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"146\" class=\"thumbimage lazyload\"></a> \t<noscript><a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/a/aa/Hatred_Hantengu.png/revision/latest?cb=20180711164234\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/a/aa/Hatred_Hantengu.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20180711164234\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"146\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-image-name=\"Hatred Hantengu.png\" data-image-key=\"Hatred_Hantengu.png\" data-src=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/a/aa/Hatred_Hantengu.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20180711164234\" /></a></noscript> \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Hatred_Hantengu.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t<p class=\"caption\">After Sekido absorbed three of his fellow Emotion Demons, the newly formed Hatred Demon forms a protective shield for the mini-Fear Hantengu</p> \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure> \n<p>Just as Sekido was about to land the fatal blow, his arm was severed by Tanjiro, causing him to land only a minor blow. As Sekido reeled from the attack, Aizetsu attempted to attack Tanjiro from behind with a flurry of air slashes. His attack was foiled by Genya, who took the brunt of the attack, allowing Tanjiro to land a blow with his fiery blade on the miniature Hantengu, who screamed in agony.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-61a29ad417745cf3ae90d4a260e8bdc4_15-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-61a29ad417745cf3ae90d4a260e8bdc4-15\">[15]</a></sup> As the Fear Demon continued to shriek, a sixth Hantengu appeared from behind Tanjiro, who continued to press his attack. However, the boost he had gotten from Nezuko's blood had ran out, the blade being halted by the miniature-Hantengu's thick neck. Genya shot at the sixth Hantengu, who struck at one of the drums on his body, summoning an amalgamation of tree and dragon, which attacked Tanjiro and flung him up into the sky. Mitsuri arrived and caught Tanjiro, gently allowing him to rest while she fought the hatred clone. The hatred clone wrapped his miniature copy in a protective covering of branches. This new form was revealed to be the result of Sekido absorbing Karaku, Urogi, and Aizetsu, who reacted with a strong glare as Tanjiro told him to stop protecting his Fear counterpart. He asked him if he had a problem with what he was doing, calling the pair of Demon Slayers evil, as the mini Hantengu cowered and trembled in his wooden protection. He answered Tanjiro's question of why he had said they were evil by pointing out their attack on his smaller version, something he called \"pure injustice\" and something \"only a savage would do\". He stood impassively as Tanjiro pointed out his misdeeds, promising to cut the Hatred Demon's head off.<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-537338f67907341502e74987d923d5ce_16-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-537338f67907341502e74987d923d5ce-16\">[16]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the end, Tanjiro manage to behead him using <b>Hinokami Kagura: Flame Dance</b>. However, the head Tanjiro just cut was not the real Hantengu, proven as the headless body of Hantengu continues to run away. As the sun is about to rise, Tanjiro finally decides to continue in via pursuit upon Nezuko sacrifice. Tanjiro eventually locates Hatengu's real body inside of Headless Hantengu's heart. Ultimately, Hantengu finally dies after having his torso slashed by Tanjiro. However, Hantengu managed to inform Muzan about Nezuko’s immunity to the sunlight beforehand.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div style=\"width:auto;
