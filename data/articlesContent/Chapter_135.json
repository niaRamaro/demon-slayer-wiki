id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p>According to what <a href=\"/wiki/Genya_Shinazugawa\" title=\"Genya Shinazugawa\">Genya</a> taught <a href=\"/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado\" title=\"Tanjiro Kamado\">Tanjiro</a>, 'Repetitive Action' is a technique that opens all five senses. Genya may not be able to use breaths, but he can achieve Total Concentration&nbsp;another way through repetitive actions. When <a href=\"/wiki/Gyomei_Himejima\" title=\"Gyomei Himejima\">Gyomei</a> and Genya use it, they remember their anger and painful memories. That makes their heart rate and temperature go up. The signs were pointing to the possibility that this might be the same as Tanjiro's mark coming out, but Gyomei and Genya had no marks, so they cocked their head in confusion.\n</p><p>By doing these repetitive actions, you can focus at any given moment and Tanjiro thought how it would be nice if he could learn how to maintain his darkened mark forever. His repetitive actions were remembering all the faces of his loved ones. Then, recalling <a href=\"/wiki/Senjuro_Rengoku\" title=\"Senjuro Rengoku\">Rengoku's</a> words “Keep your heart burning.” and with that, he was able to raise his focus to its maximum limit. Tanjiro couldn't do it in the beginning but he was able to use all the strength he had by doing these repetitive actions. As he did them again and again, his body began to remember the way to bring out that power through these actions. Eventually, he was able to push the boulder, slowly but surely. <a href=\"/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira\" title=\"Inosuke Hashibira\">Inosuke</a> was also able to push his by thinking about tempura with <a href=\"/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma\" title=\"Zenitsu Agatsuma\">Zenitsu</a> looking dismayed as he will be left out only to be distracted by his sparrow with a letter addressed to him.\n</p><p>Tanjiro was able to move his boulder across a town finishing the Rock Hashira's training but was left dehydrated. Gyomei then gave him water and accepted him as a swordsman recalling Tanjiro's actions in the swordsmith village when he prioritized the villagers over his younger sister during the crisis. Tanjiro however did not accept his praise as <a href=\"/wiki/Nezuko_Kamado\" title=\"Nezuko Kamado\">Nezuko</a> was the one who\nmade that decision and not him. Upon hearing this, Gyomei noted how different Tanjiro is as to him, children are pure and naive, weak, quick to lie, completely fine with cruelty, and selfish little things.\n</p><p>Gyomei then told Tanjiro his story about how he raised some kids who had no family in a temple before he became a Demon Slayer. Their affinity in having no blood connections helped them bond together very well and he raised them like his family, Gyomei wanted to keep life that way forever. But then one night, a kid disobeyed the temple rules and didn't come back after sunset and ran into a demon. In order to save himself, the boy told the demon to eat Gyomei and the 8 kids at the temple. The kid put out all the wisteria incense Gyomei burned as protection and invited the demon into the temple which resulted in 4 kids dying immediately. Gyomei tried to protect the other 4 but 3 didn't listen to him, ran and died, only Sayo (the youngest) listened and hid behind.\n</p><p>In order to protect Sayo, Gyomei fought and punched the demon's head again and again until the sun came up. He was able to protect Sayo but when people came to help, Sayo who was only 4 years old that time got confused and labelled Gyomei a monster who killed all the children. As a result, Gyomei was imprisoned and charged with murder. If <a href=\"/wiki/Kagaya_Ubuyashiki\" title=\"Kagaya Ubuyashiki\">Kagaya</a> had not intervened, he would have been executed and ever since, he had come to harbor deep doubts and suspicions that no matter how virtuous you are, once you get pushed into a corner, your true nature will come out. But Tanjiro never ran and stayed honest and never lied. Seeing as Tanjiro is a special child, Gyomei promised to help him so that Tanjiro won't take a wrong turn in life.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Characters_in_Order_of_Appearance\">Characters in Order of Appearance</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/Genya_Shinazugawa\" title=\"Genya Shinazugawa\">Genya Shinazugawa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado\" title=\"Tanjiro Kamado\">Tanjiro Kamado</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma\" title=\"Zenitsu Agatsuma\">Zenitsu Agatsuma</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira\" title=\"Inosuke Hashibira\">Inosuke Hashibira</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/wiki/Gyomei_Himejima\" title=\"Gyomei Himejima\">Gyomei Himejima</a></li>\n<li>Sayo</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Events\">Events</span></h2>\n\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210108141236\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.218 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.287 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 9305/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 168903/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 78187/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 28/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  168.769      1 -total\n 83.55%  140.999      1 Template:Manga_Navigation\n 81.73%  137.938      1 Template:Navibox\n 56.29%   94.998     26 Template:Navibox/info\n 31.66%   53.435     26 Template:Element_List\n 13.51%   22.806      1 Template:Chapter_Infobox\n 10.61%   17.913     26 Template:Force_Font_Color\n  2.79%    4.712      1 Template:Nihongo\n  1.06%    1.789      5 Template:Ruby\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:kimetsunoyaiba:pcache:idhash:1239-0!canonical and timestamp 20210108141236 and revision id 74409\n -->\n</div>"}
