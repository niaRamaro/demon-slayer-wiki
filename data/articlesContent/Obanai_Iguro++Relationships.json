Having since the day he was born, continuously been dotted and pampered by his family to the most extremist degree. Having raised and sheltered him in a perfectly secured lattice cell room for his \"safety\" since birth, feed him the finest,tastiest foods since he was little and kept him completely sheltered from everything and gave him everything he could ever need and insured that he would never want anything since the day he was born. However Obanai himself admitted that although he was ignorant of the true reason for their over indulgence and extreme protectiveness to him, he himself was disgusted by their constant pampering of him, having greatly hated the excessive amounts of fine foods they would prepare and serve him due to the fact that the severe smells and oders of the food made his nose ache and the extremely secured room's poor ventilation only worsened the problem and the severe isolation that they kept him in also increased his initial hostility to his relatives.\n</p><p>However upon learning of the true reason for their overly protectiveness towards him due to him being their \"offering\" to their <a href=\"/wiki/Snake_Demon\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Snake Demon\">benefactor</a> and the true source of his families immense wealth and prosperity, Obanai became completely disgusted by his relatives greed,selfishness and amorality. So much so that he possessed little to no care or guilt at his attempts to run away despite suspecting of what the demon would do to them if he did in order to prioritize his own freedom and safety.\n</p><p>However upon the demon's death and learning of the mass murder of all fifty of his relatives at the demon's hand for their failure to keep him imprisoned and the sharp,resentful,selfish rejection of his last surviving cousin, who blamed him for \"selfishly\" not letting the Demon eat him. Obanai still developed a severe sense of self loathing due to being born to a clan of selfish,amoral people and later despite knowing he had no control over their deaths, Obanai still developed a immense sense of guilt for letting them die to save himself despite their selfishness towards him. So much so that this even prevented him from even trying to find happiness for his own due to believing that he was not worthy of it due to his bloodline and inherit \"selfishness\".\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mitsuri_Kanroji\"><a href=\"/wiki/Mitsuri_Kanroji\" title=\"Mitsuri Kanroji\">Mitsuri Kanroji</a></span></h3>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p><figure class=\"thumb tleft show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 152px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/b/be/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_CH124.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320142859\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Kimetsu no Yaiba CH124.png\" src=\"/images/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_CH124.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"150\" height=\"219\" class=\"thumbimage\"></a> \t \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_CH124.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure><p>\nObanai is deeply in love with Mitsuri, but pride, nervousness and the fact that he feels he is not worthy of her due to his \"filthy blood\"<sup id=\"cite_ref-auto-c1b0f0eeb69d54c8fff5e7a29250a279_1-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-auto-c1b0f0eeb69d54c8fff5e7a29250a279-1\">[1]</a></sup> keep him from being forthright. He gives her gifts, keeps correspondence through letters, and is protective of her, and, while she enjoys the attention he gives her, she seems oblivious to his feelings but it is revealed that she also likes him. After the battle with Muzan, Obanai is seen cradling Mitsuri's body but, although both are still alive, they already felt that they were going to die soon. Obanai reminisces about the first time they met at Ubayashiki's mansion and how Mitsuri saved him by making him feel like a normal young man and how he won't let anyone say anything bad about her. In the end Mitsuri confesses that she likes him and that the meals she ate with him were the best. She also states that he has always been looking at her so gently and asks him if he'd take her as his wife if they are reborn as humans again. Obanai replies that if she's fine being with someone like him then he'll definitely make her happy and that, next time, he will protect her for sure. This vow eventually happens as their reincarnations are married to each other.\n</p><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Giyu_Tomioka\"><a href=\"/wiki/Giyu_Tomioka\" title=\"Giyu Tomioka\">Giyu Tomioka</a></span></h3>\n<p>Obanai hated Giyu for unclear reasons, though Obanai's temper may be a large factor in it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tanjiro_Kamado\"><a href=\"/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado\" title=\"Tanjiro Kamado\">Tanjiro Kamado</a></span></h3>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p><figure class=\"thumb tright show-info-icon\" style=\"width: 202px\"> \t<a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kimetsu-no-yaiba/images/d/de/Obanai_protecting_Tanjiro_CH182.png/revision/latest?cb=20200111201755\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Obanai protecting Tanjiro CH182.png\" src=\"/images/Obanai_protecting_Tanjiro_CH182.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"164\" class=\"thumbimage\"></a> \t \t<figcaption class=\"thumbcaption\"> \t\t \t\t\t<a href=\"/wiki/File:Obanai_protecting_Tanjiro_CH182.png\" class=\"info-icon\"><svg><use xlink:href=\"#wds-icons-info-small\"></use></svg></a> \t\t \t\t \t\t \t</figcaption> </figure><p>\nObanai also hated Tanjiro with a passion, even more than he hated Giyu. It started with Tanjiro's breach of Demon Slayer conduct and insubordination during the Hashira meeting, but intensified after Tanjiro interacted with Mitsuri during the Swordsmith Village attack and completed her Hashira Training with raving reviews. As the story goes on, Obanai shows something of warmth towards Tanjiro. An example is when Tanjiro gets slashed in the eye by Muzan, and Obanai jumps in to protect him. They also work together to fight against Muzan when Obanai loses his eyesight due to an injury, Tanjiro gives Kaburamaru one of Yushiro's seals that allows Obanai to see what his snake sees, aiding in the battle.\n</p><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\"></p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kyojuro_Rengoku\"><a href=\"/wiki/Kyojuro_Rengoku\" title=\"Kyojuro Rengoku\">Kyojuro Rengoku</a></span></h3>\n<p>Obanai seemed to deeply respect Kyojuro and held him in a high standard. He believed he was extremely powerful, expressing his disbelief when he died.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tengen_Uzui\"><a href=\"/wiki/Tengen_Uzui\" title=\"Tengen Uzui\">Tengen Uzui</a></span></h3>\n<p>Despite Tengen's victory against Upper Rank 6, Obanai downplays this significant achievement to instead emphasize the extent of his injuries. Tengen, for his part, brushes aside Obanai's concerns, insisting on retiring and disagreeing with the latter's sentiment that the Demon Slayers were going into decline.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-auto-c1b0f0eeb69d54c8fff5e7a29250a279-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-auto-c1b0f0eeb69d54c8fff5e7a29250a279_1-0\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><i>Kimetsu no Yaiba</i> Manga: <a href=\"/wiki/Chapter_188\" title=\"Chapter 188\">Chapter 188</a> (Page 20).</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20210113092403\nCache expiry: 1209600\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.181 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.201 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6426/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 0/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 98857/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 39111/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 501/5000000 bytes\nLua time usage: 0.007/7.000 seconds\nLua memory usage: 744 KB/50 MB\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%  130.966      1 -total\n 72.14%   94.479      1 Template:Character_Navigation\n 68.55%   89.779      1 Template:Navibox\n 36.70%   48.068     18 Template:Navibox/info\n 31.12%   40.759     18 Template:Element_List\n 22.73%   29.769      1 Template:Ref\n 16.81%   22.009      1 Template:Ref/name\n  8.41%   11.009     18 Template:Force_Font_Color\n  3.98%    5.208      1 Template:Tabs\n  2.23%    2.923      1 Template:Ref/contents\n-->\n\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key prod:kimetsunoyaiba:pcache:idhash:15008-0!canonical and timestamp 20210113092402 and revision id 73863\n -->\n</div>"}
